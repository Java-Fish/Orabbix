# Orabbix
This is a fork from Orabbix from Andrea Dalle Vacche. The original code can be found on sourceforge --> https://sourceforge.net/projects/orabbix/

I will try to push this project to Java 8 and comply with the rules of CleanCode inthe future.

Builded jar can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Java-Fish/Orabbix/blob/3cfcee11173ed4ce4c375482024bb607945ac07a/build-jar/orabbix.jar
