# Orabbix ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

Since the current Agent2 of Zabbix can only read Oracle databases of versions 12 and higher, this Java-based plugin was created. A detailed manual is available on the website:
https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1847294
Since this page is in Chinese I tried to summarize it here.

The plugin is a fork of Andrea Dalle Vacche. The original code can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/orabbix/

Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)

Here is the original wiki from Vacche: http://www.smartmarmot.com/wiki/index.php?title=Orabbix#Authors

I will try to push this project to Java 8 and comply with the rules of CleanCode inthe future.

Builded jar can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Java-Fish/Orabbix/raw/3cfcee11173ed4ce4c375482024bb607945ac07a/build-jar/orabbix.jar
