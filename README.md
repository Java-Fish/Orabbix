# Orabbix ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

Since the current Agent2 of Zabbix can only read Oracle databases of versions 12 and higher, this Java-based plugin was created.
A detailed manual is available on the website:
https://wiki.liutyi.info/display/DEVOPS/Orabbix+Oracle+monitoring+with+Zabbix

The plugin is a fork of Andrea Dalle Vacche. The original code can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/orabbix/

Here is the original wiki from Vacche: http://www.smartmarmot.com/wiki/index.php?title=Orabbix#Authors

I will try to push the jar inside his project to Java 8 and will remove Log4j

Builded jar can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Java-Fish/Orabbix/raw/3cfcee11173ed4ce4c375482024bb607945ac07a/build-jar/orabbix.jar
